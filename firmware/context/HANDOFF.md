# Firmware handoff

## Current F1 handoff - 2026-10-04

User explicitly asked to implement all four F1 bench sketches while other F0
checks continue. All four are now implemented and compile, plus the both-servo
variant. This preparation does not claim hardware gates passed. No flashing.
See ../TEAM_TESTING.md for exact team setup, uploads, observations and reporting.
S3 pan1/tilt2; C3 pixel7, I2S4/5/6 left/SHIFT14, optional IR1 active-low provisional.
Serial115200. No Wi-Fi/secrets needed. Camera/voice integration sketches not done.

Existing HEAD5194c5ed39c02b2bcc91bfaef899492f5788838c. Intended testing message:
fw phase 1: add bench sketches for hardware testing. No staging/commit/push here.
Shared context was refreshed under user's permission; preserve app-team records.
Next action: user commits/pushes actual firmware, team runs GateF1, then await
F1 DONE. Fix reported failures within F1; do not start F2 ahead of hardware
results. Remaining F0 facts, camera PWDN/RESET and confirmed network plan tracked.
HARDWARE_PLAN.md absent. Live network verification deferred until Wi-Fi firmware.

Earlier entries are historical.

2026-10-04: user started FIRMWARE_PLAN.md as Session B and allowed shared root
context updates. F0 scaffold/toolchain set up; both generic compile probes passed
with library warnings. See ../STATUS.md. Actual S3 model, pin availability, PSRAM mode,
hotspot subnet/IP plan and flashing ports remain unknown; F0 DONE not received.
HARDWARE_PLAN.md missing. No flashing or F1 implementation.

User committed/pushed preparation for a different testing team. Current HEAD
993e3d5f51fb7ea9d6a8a9212a5e485a3c93151e; live origin/main verified equal.
Message: fw phase 0: prepare toolchain and scaffold for team testing.
F0 board acceptance remains pending. This post-push update is uncommitted.
Before every subsequent commit refresh root
HANDOFF/PROGRESS/TESTING and STATUS, plus relevant decisions/project records.
Stage explicit paths only; app Phase 2 and plan-review changes predate this work.

Exact next action: print Gate F0 verbatim and
wait for board facts with F0 DONE. Revalidate actual profile after confirmation.

## Network report - 2026-10-04

User supplied Arduino interface addresses:
172.20.0.1, 172.17.0.1, 172.18.0.1, 172.19.0.1, 192.168.29.199,
2405:201:f025:d03c:f99c:335:258b:cfa0.
Recorded as candidate Uno Q addresses, not a confirmed shared-network UNOQ_IP.
Interface names, shared hotspot subnet/gateway and S3/C3 reachability are unknown.
Do not select an address from this list or change secrets/config until confirmed.
User says other checks are ongoing and will confirm once done. F0 DONE has not
been received. F0 board facts remain pending; no F1 work or flashing performed.
Next action: await board facts and confirmation of the Uno Q IPv4 address that
S3/C3 can reach on their shared network, plus the remaining F0 checks/F0 DONE.
Existing verified HEAD/remote: 993e3d5f51fb7ea9d6a8a9212a5e485a3c93151e.
This network/handoff update is local and uncommitted; no new commit/push.

## Board facts update - 2026-10-04

User identifies the camera board as ESP32 S3 CAM DEVKIT N16R8 DUAL PORT WITH
2MP CAMERA and reports servos connected to GPIO 1/2. Preserve planned mapping
pan=GPIO 1, tilt=GPIO 2; wiring report is not a completed servo/power test.
Exact-name seller listing found: Tomson Electronics SKU SEN-29083, 16MB flash,
8MB PSRAM, UART+OTG USB, RHYX M21-45 2MP camera:
https://www.tomsonelectronics.com/products/esp32-s3-cam-devkit-n16r8-dual-port-with-2mp-camera
No board-specific camera GPIO map established from that listing. Do not assume
ESP32S3_EYE or another core camera profile merely from the N16R8 module label.
Obtain seller schematic/pin map or matching board documentation before F2.
Network clarification: user notes live S3/C3 reachability can only be checked
once Wi-Fi firmware is flashed. Defer live connectivity verification to F2/F3;
static network values can be configured beforehand once the subnet is known.
Other F0 checks are ongoing per user. F0 DONE not received; F1 not started.
Next action: await remaining F0 toolchain/board facts and F0 DONE; obtain actual
camera pin map before camera implementation. No flash, commit or push here.

## Confirmed wiring and sensor - 2026-10-04

User explicitly confirms pan=GPIO 1, tilt=GPIO 2, and camera sensor=OV3660
on the ESP32 S3 CAM DEVKIT N16R8 dual-port board. OV3660 supersedes the earlier
2MP/RHYX seller description for this user's installed sensor. Sensor model
confirmation does not establish camera bus/control GPIO wiring; actual board
camera pin map remains pending before F2. Do not assume a core camera profile.
F0 DONE not received; other F0 checks remain pending. No F1 implementation,
flashing, new compile check, commit or push in this update.
Next action: await remaining F0 confirmation and F0 DONE, then implement F1.
Live S3/C3 network verification remains deferred until Wi-Fi firmware flashing.

## Camera pinout evidence - 2026-10-04

User supplied an ESP32-S3-CAM N16R8 pinout diagram. Read directly from it:
SIOD=4, SIOC=5, XCLK=15, VSYNC=6, HREF=7, PCLK=13;
D0/Y2=11, D1/Y3=9, D2/Y4=8, D3/Y5=10, D4/Y6=12, D5/Y7=18,
D6/Y8=17, D7/Y9=16. All 14 labelled camera signals exactly match the installed
Arduino ESP32 core 3.3.11 CameraWebServer CAMERA_MODEL_ESP32S3_EYE entry.
This is pin-map correspondence, not identification as a physical S3-EYE board.
Diagram does not label camera PWDN/RESET. Core entry uses -1/-1; those two
connections remain unverified and must not be represented as image-confirmed.
GPIO 1 and 2 have no camera assignment in this diagram; retain user-confirmed
pan=1 and tilt=2. Camera sensor remains user-confirmed OV3660.
No camera implementation, physical test or flashing performed. F0 DONE still
pending. Next action: await remaining F0 confirmation/resume phrase, then F1.
At F2 use this documented map, resolve PWDN/RESET via board documentation or
team confirmation, and verify camera initialization on hardware. No commit/push.

## Firmware documentation commit preparation - 2026-10-04

User requested commands to commit/push the documented board facts for team
review. Existing HEAD: 73077515675bfa622279da0254a7ae7ca674f8ad.
Intended message: fw docs: record board wiring and camera pinout for team review.
This is a documentation handoff, not new executable firmware or F0 completion.
F0 DONE and remaining checks pending; F1 sketches not implemented. Camera
PWDN/RESET still unverified. Live connectivity deferred to Wi-Fi flashing.
Git diff --check passed. No new compile/hardware tests run for these records.
Shared context currently contains app team's concurrent Phase 3 records:
selectively stage only Session B updates there and preserve app implementation.
Next action: user reviews/stages firmware documentation and corresponding shared
context updates, commits/pushes; then await remaining F0 checks and F0 DONE.
No staging, commit or push performed by this agent for this preparation.
